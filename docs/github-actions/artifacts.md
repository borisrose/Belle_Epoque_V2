# Artifacts

## Persist data

Artifacts allow you to persist data after a job has completed, and share that
data with another job in the <span class="important">same workflow</span>.

## Definition

An artifact is a file or collection of files produced during a workflow run.

## Example

Y can use artifacts to save your build and test output after a workflow run has
ended.

All actions and workflows called within a run have write access to that run's
artifacts.
